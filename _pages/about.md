This is **Matin Rouhani**, a mining engineering MSc graduate (with a full mark GPA :) ) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). I specialize in numerical modeling and soft computing techniques to design cutting tools and mechanized excavations. 

After I graduated on September 12th, I started working as an independent researcher on a variety of subjects. I attempt to discover relationships between relevant factors and simplify the more complex themes of mechanized excavations.

I've devoted my entire life to science, and I firmly think that if I work hard, I can significantly improve and ease the lives of others. As they say, "_Hard work beats talent when talent does not work hard_".

Additionally, I'm interested in the following topics: 
*  predicting TBM performance
*  predicting cutter wear
*  designing cutterhead layouts
*  designing cutting tools.

Any scholarly cooperation is welcome. Do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any ideas or interests.
