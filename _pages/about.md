This is **Matin Rouhani**, a mining engineering MSc graduate (with a full mark GPA :) ) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). I am originally from Zanjan, Iran. I specialize in numerical modeling and soft computing techniques to design cutting tools and mechanized excavations. 

After I graduated, I started working as an independent researcher on a variety of subjects. I attempt to discover relationships between relevant factors and simplify the more complex themes of mechanized excavations.

Additionally, I'm interested in the following topics: 
*  predicting TBM performance
*  predicting cutter wear
*  designing cutterhead layouts
*  designing cutting tools.

Any scholarly cooperation is welcome. Do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any ideas or interests.
