This is **Matin Rouhani**, a mining engineering MSc graduate (with a full mark GPA :) ) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). I specialize in numerical modeling and soft computing techniques to design cutting tools and mechanized excavations. 

After I graduated on September 12th, I started working as an independent researcher on a variety of subjects. I attempt to discover relationships between relevant factors and simplify the more complex themes of mechanized excavations.

My hobbies when I am not researching include photography and music. When I'm working, I like to listen to classical jazz. When I was younger, I also played water polo, but I gave that up to concentrate on my work as a scholar.

I've devoted my entire life to science, and I firmly think that if I work hard, I can significantly improve and ease the lives of others. As they say, "hard work beats talent when talent does not work hard".

Any scholarly cooperation is welcome. Do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any ideas or interests.
