I am Matin Rouhani, a mining engineering MSc graduate (with a full mark GPA :) ) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). I am originally from Zanjan, Iran. I specialize in numerical modeling and soft computing techniques, as well as designing cutting tools and mechanized excavations. 

After graduating, I started working as an independent researcher on various subjects. I attempt to discover relationships between relevant factors and simplify the more complex themes of mechanized excavations.

I have **five journal publications** and **four conference publications**. Some articles are **under review**, and I am constantly **working on new ones**.

Additionally, I'm interested in the following topics: 
*  predicting TBM performance
*  predicting cutter wear
*  designing cutterhead layouts
*  designing cutting tools.

Any scholarly cooperation is welcome. Do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any ideas or interests.
