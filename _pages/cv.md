Work experience
======
* Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran
  June 2023 - December 2023
  Research Assistant, Department of Mining Engineering
  The following topics have been covered during my R.A. in the mining engineering Dept. of AUT:
o	Constitutive model calibration for the low-strength rocks and soils (softgrounds).
o	Structural analysis and support system design for the squeezing-involved mines.

  Methodology:
o	Numerical modeling (using LS-DYNA and FLAC softwares)


* University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran
  March 2020 - June 2021
  Research Assistant, Department of Mining Engineering
o	Participated as an R.A., and also as a internship trainee.

  The following topics have been covered during my R.A. in the mining engineering Dept. of the University of Zanjan:
o	Fiber reinforced concretes; different mixing plans investigation
o	Physical property tests, including wetting and drying tests, Schmidt hammer tests, uniaxial compressive tests, triaxial compressive tests, Brazilian tests, and point-load index testing, were conducted on the designed fiber-reinforced concrete specimens.

  Methodology:
o	Laboratoary investigations.
